if a user has not logged into sls for that day

The server must be smart enough to redirect the user to the login page as user has not logged in yet

Usually when a user enters the domain name only of a website, the web server will respond to the client the default page

#Array vs Lnked list:
-Array allows for easy direct access (a[2] = 'gay')
linked list needs to traverse from the head

-Array allows direct memory access
-LL does not allow access

-linked list is dynamic in nature as if list is full, can still add more
array cannot add more items if full

-array transfers data which is more time consuming
linked list transfers pointers, data remains in the same place

#Array
-Direct access (stack mem)
-Quick in read/write (stack mem)
-Data is contingous

#Linear queue
in dome uses, where the linear queue has gone through a sequeue of En and De , even though queue is not full , enqueue

psuedocode for circular queue:

begin delete_item procedure
	if size = 0 then write ('Queue Underflow')
	else
		deleted_item = item(front)
		size = size -1
		if front = limit then front = 1
		else front = front +1
		endif
	endif
end procedure

#lnked list:
OS WILL NOT keep track of the items in the list
the program will not keep track of the what items are in the list

head- address of the first node is stored here
nextfree- stores the addr of the next available node for insertion

#hash table
~use of array
~Hash function
~key-value pair
~collision due to repeated hashed value
	dealt with:
	-linear probing
	-chaining
